## Local Storage

Local storage is one aspect where native applications are still better than web based applications.  Through the years there have been multiple data storage programs that still didn't quite do the job for storing local data remotely.  Cookies serve their purpose for persistent data storage, but have a couple of key downfalls.  They slow down your app's transmitting process without doing anything too useful, and they carry unsecured data through the web.  We need a lot of storage on the client server that will be persistent on refresh, and stays secured.  Before HTML5 there hadn't been anything that quite accomplished this.  The goal for HTML5 was to provide an API that could be standard across multiple browsers without third party plug ins.

So, with HTML5, we have 5GB's of data to store information locally within it's own file system.  Plug ins still are used a lot with HTML5, but that is more of data libraries that have the code for commonly used functions.  Using these libraries you are able to call on the methods that they provide instead of hand writing that code.  Basically senior coders have compiled all of the hard work of coding into these libraries for future coders to apply.  Even so, HTML5 up to this point has been the only effective method of utilizing local storage remotely.  However, there are new methods being developed and worked on, among these indexedDB, or indexed data base.  The concept here is based on object stores, which are giant data caches that are split up into types of data and called upon accordingly.  It is still only in technology demo mode, but this could very well be the next big innovation in technology.
