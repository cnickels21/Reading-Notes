## HTML Lists, CSS Boxes

There are three types of lists you can create using html. Ordered lists will display each list item with a number, unordered lists display with bullet points, and definition lists are used to display a set of different terms and terminology. You can also create nested lists by writing a secondary list tag into your first list. Now, in HTML, every single element is displayed as a separate block, including individual list items; meaning that each new item will be displayed on a new line. This is where you will use CSS to change how these blocks are displayed, and how the respond to the blocks surrounding them. In order to accomplish this, you need to understand the layout of each individual box. Every box has a border that surrounds the content. The padding of a box is how much space is between the content and the border. Finally, you have the margin; the amount of space between the boxes border and the surrounding elements.

Now, there are many different ways to customize your boxes. You can change the dimensions of the boxes in your page, or even in relation to its parent element. You can also set minimum and maximum widths and heights, which is very useful for people who will view your page on different devices. It is important to remember that when you adjust a boxes margin or padding you are physically increasing the dimensions of the box \(ie. if your box width is set to 300 pixels, increasing the padding left by 20 pixels would set the boxes full width to 320 pixels\). You are able to change block elements into in-line elements, and vice versa \(this is very useful when working with a list that you want to display horizontally instead of vertically such as the navigation buttons you have at the top of your web page\). You can even customize the border and color of boxes to make items appear as buttons. You can give those buttons rounded corners by changing the radius of the border. A lot of your box customization is in relation to readability and user friendliness.  It allows you to space elements out so they aren't invading each others space, and create proper presentability as well as visual hierarchy.

## JS Control Flow

In an earlier page we talked about different operators in JavaScript and how they are used with different datatypes to return different outcomes. Next we will talk about loops and how they are used to return different outcomes based on different input without having to write a different code block for each scenario. The three types of loops are for loops, while loops, and do while loops. The for loop is used to run a set of code a specific number of times, a while loop is used when you don't know how many times the code needs to run, and a do while loop will perform the code inside your curly braces at least once no matter what condition you have set. Loops will run infinitely until a condition using a comparative operator returns as false. You can also use the keyword break inside a loop if a condition has been met therefore not needing to run the rest of the code within that loop. Also the keyword 'continue' allows you to stop a current iteration and check the condition again. I have noticed that a large use of loops and if\else statements is to minimize the use of redundant code within your script, but they also allow you to control how your web page will respond to the user based on their input. You set the rules, the computer interprets and acts, and then the user receives the information they were looking for.
