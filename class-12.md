## The HTML <\canvas> Element & Chart.js

Charts are a much more efficient way of displaying data to the user than tables.  They are much more customizable and able to be reactive to what is happinging on the page.  We can accomplish this using the canvas element in HTML.  This element only has two attributes, being width and height, that you can customize, but if you do not set these the chart defaults to 300px wide by 150px high.  Using the canvas element, JavaScript offers many clever ways to draw shapes and designs onto your page through its draw function.  Based on a grid system where your origin point is the top left corner set to \(0x 0y\) you can specify where any given line starts and where it is drawn to.  There is a vast array of property value pairs that allow you to customize how lines are drawn and how interact with each other.  From circles to squares, gradients, styles and colors, onto how space is filled according to your created lines, the canvas element is a playground that allows you to customize data output to best suit your needs.

This process can be tedious to do from scratch, but is very important for a junior dev to understand.  However, Chart.js is a plugin library that allows you to implement predesigned charts into your page using your canvas element.  It is a very useful tool and will save you loads of time in the process of structuring data output on your web pages.  There are key differences in how to implement different charts into your page.  For the different chart types you create a new Chart by using the respected method \('.line', '.pie', '.bar', etc.\). Then, once you have specified the chart type, you insert the data into that chart by declaring variables that those methods use as arguements.  You are still able to customize the visual layout of your charts, but this library does most of the leg work for you.

Overall, the canvas element in HTML is an extremely effective method of displaying data to your users, whether you are hand-building your chart or pulling templates from a library.  What you can create visually is only limited by your own creative juices, and this includes adding animated and interactive charts to respond to your users and clients.  Whether this is creating a chart that will change based on newly acquired data that will get implemented into your script, or just having a chart display based on an event listener and how the chart will render itself into the page.  The possibilities are boundless, and who doesn't want a creative playground when writing code!
