## React Native

React native is different than reactJS in that its core capability is to render the UI/UX within iOS and android mobile systems.  It is extremely convenient for you to launch a mobile application to the google or apple play stores.  Also, it is a separate framework from reactJS but still functions in the same way.

With react native you still have class and function components that speak to and rely on each other to bring all of the moving parts together into a fluid user experience, but there are not separate html and css files.  Instead, native has its own built in components and dependencies that allow you to write your markup and styling directly into your code, adversely to the way that many templating languages allow you to write your code into your markup.

At the end of the day, react native is a highly efficient framework that allows you to build your mobile application all within one project and manage the deployment effectively through expo.  Expo is what allows you to launch to a play store or app store accordingly and manage all of the data related to your app through them.  There are ways to eject from expo and deploy your app manually, but that also involves managing and maintaining all of your data yourself, and I recommend that as a beginner, or even amateur, using expo will make your life much easier.
