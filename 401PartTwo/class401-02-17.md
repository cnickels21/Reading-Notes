## Open Source Software

Programming is a wide world of innovation, and is chalk full of wonderful people willing to help new programmers gain the experience they need to step into the industry.  Open source software is a great opportunity for beginners to dabble in programs that interest them and gain positive and helpful feedback on how to improve in the industry.  On top of it, contributions to open source programs and applications add a lot to a resume, and is even sought after by some companies.

The idea is that a project is created for anyone to have access to the source code for modifying and adding to, within a reasonable code of conduct, and of course with proper PR reviews.  But the internet itself was largely built on OSS as it is also a way for software or a program to be designed and available without any usage restrictions.  As a gamer, OSS has had a direct impact on my life without me having realized it.  OSS is what allows local devices to be able to go out into the cloud and speak to each other accordingly.

At the end of the day, the wide world of programming has no limit to the opportunity it offers a programmer of any skill level, and open source software is just another way for you to get your hands wet and dive into a new opportunity for practice and growth.
