## Custom Hooks

React has a fair few built in hooks, most commonly use state, use effect, and use context, but there are also a few others that might come into play depending on what you are attempting to do with your program.  However, the nerdy react community has also written many custom hooks that can be installed through npm packages and serve the purpose of making a programmer's life easier by giving you base functionality that you will run into every single day of programming \(i.e. use array, react fetch hook for api calls, and so on\).

However, writing your own custom hooks is a great way to write clean and dry code, meaning that you have to write less lines in any given file, you are following the single purpose principle, and repetitive code is broken out into a reusable function.  Speaking of functions, that's all a hook is!  Only with a few more specific rules about how they can be used.  They can only be used within function components at the top level or within another hook \(like useEffect inside of your custom hook component\).

The purpose of the hook is to replace repetitive and unnecessary code with a single line that will call a hook that you are utilizing to achieve your effect.  They also allow you to capture state at any given moment and be able to process handling a promise or async/await method, but still allow the app to continue rendering updated information while the hook does its behind the scenes job!  At the end of the day, hooks in react were a game changer for react programmers and have a huge role to play in the future of react apps.
