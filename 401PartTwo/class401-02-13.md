## Context in React

There are a lot of nuances around how react functions, being that any given component's state is always updating and changing, and children of a component have to update every time a parent updates.  This causes a lot of unnecessary rendering in our application.  Context is a way to help remedy this performance bug.  By creating context in the top level component, the *provider*, we capture data that can be passed around and only update or re-render when absolutely necessary.

Part of what makes react somewhat cumbersome is the potential for many layers of inheritance and the fact that passing state and props around causes a lot of duplicate and unnecessary code.  Context allows us to pass it around without it having to be used in unnecessary places.  This allows us to not only clean up the code, but clean up the performance in our app.

It is also possible to capture context within a hook that then can be used globally, which is very useful when multiple unrelated components need access to the same set of information.  The possibilities are quite surmountable, but what methodology you use inside the functionality of your app depends largely on what you are attempting to accomplish, and is there an easier way to accomplish that.  Context is just another option for simplifying your code.
