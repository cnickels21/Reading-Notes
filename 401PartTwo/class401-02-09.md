## Component Composition

The idea behind react is that you have a single page application that auto-magically re-renders the state of the application frequently based on defined changes through user interaction.  The concept is all about dynamic reactivity to continuously keep your application fresh and ready.  However, being a single page app, a react application still has a significant amount of moving parts under the hood.

These parts are called components that are defined as classes or functions that are passed around accordingly along with their own state and props.  However, a complex app may want or need several independently defined sets of moving parts to accomplish the task.  Remember that it is important to have related and dependent components defined together in their own directory within the project.

Even so, this is where routing comes in to play so that we can access all of the different parts of our application from everywhere.  We gain this capability by installing the router package that comes with the react framework and wrapping our entire application class in this routing.  We can now define different paths to render different sets of JSX accordingly.  We still have the full capability to modulize and pass around data and functions accordingly, only now we have a new level of control over how our app reacts to create a friendly user experience.
