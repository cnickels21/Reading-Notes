## Comparing JavaScript Frameworks

Besides react, there are a few other javascript frameworks that all have their respected pros and cons depending on what you want to be able to accomplish with your application.  The differences between the frameworks boil down to how and when code is generated and rendered, be it on the server side, on build, or, as in react, dynamically on the client side.  Two of the main frameworks beyond react include next.js and gatsby.

Next allows you to handle server side rendering, meaning that it is great for creating a friendly user experience when you are working with static data.  It also has better SEO than react because react requires all of the javascript to be run before it can be analyzed accordingly.  Granted there are pre-rendering capabilities that you can implement in react to optimize SEO, but that involves extra steps when you could just use a different framework.

Then there's gatsby, which renders on build and allows for continuous integration and development.  It is kind of a middle ground where you have optimized SEO, but also have the benefits of dynamic rendering of html and data.  Again, they all have use cases where one is better than the other, but gatsby seems to offer the most, generally speaking, as it comes with a subset of tools and plug ins that offer a lot.
