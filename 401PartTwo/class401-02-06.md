## React in a Nutshell

React is a javascript library that allows you to capture, control, and create a dynamic and efficient user experience through a crossover of HTML and JavaScript.  The library gives you the capability to access html that has been hard written and update it according to user actions, model state changes, and so much more.  You can also dynamically generate html elements within your javascript and render them accordingly.  Aaaand, you are able to update the state of your application from a UI standard in real time without having to reload everything.  Only the selected, necessary element will be updated within the state of the application.

The two defining keywords of react are *component* and *state*.  These two concepts describe your application model and how elements within it react to the ever-changing state of the application dynamically and efficiently.  The state represents what is happening behind the scenes of your application and how that is being displayed to the user.  Ultimately, we want the user to have a friendly experience no matter what state our application is in.  Components are what our DOM consists of and how they are able to adapt to the ever-changing state of the application.  At the end of the day, it is a matter of effectively generating a user experience in reaction to what the user is trying to do.
