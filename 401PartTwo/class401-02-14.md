## Login and Authorization

There are a couple of aspects and necessary implementations for creating login and authorization capabilities within a react application.  For any component that you want to lock down and require authentication or authorization needs to get wrapped in the <\Login /> and <\Auth /> jsx tags respectively.  These then allow you to define how a user is able to interact with certain parts of your app, if at all, and what rights they have within your app.

There is also role based access control \(rbac\) which is a tool that was designed to give a product owner more control over who has what access rights and how to easily maintain and manage that within a company.  It allows you to define access control groups that you can easily add to and update.  For example, you may have an employee that temporarily needs higher level access to complete a certain feature.  You are able to add that employee to a higher level group and then remove them when that feature is finished.

However, within the react app itself, you need cookies to manage and maintain users and what their authorization levels are.  By installing the cookie package, you have access to assigning cookies and tokens to certain users and they come with a plethora of properties that you can access and pass around the application accordingly.  This allows you to specifically define how much access is given for each individual aspect of your app.
