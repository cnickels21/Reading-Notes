## EJS

Embedded JavaScript, or EJS, is server side JS that allows you to generate HTML markup using JSON, databases, APIs, and such.  It is essentially a middle man templating dependency that you can install and use to render data to your web page from the back end.  Once you have your server set up requiring express, cors, and everything else, you also require ejs and then, once your app paths have been defined \(your home page or about page for example\) you can then inject your ejs markup using the response.render method inside of that path.  This render method takes three arguments; the file path to your ejs file \(stored in a views folder in your directory\), your object of local variables \(this is where you define what data you are using to inject into your html\), and a callback depending on how you are getting your data to be rendered.

Now that you have installed your ejs module and set it up with your server \(oh, don't forget to set your server to listen on a port\) you must also install an express ejs layouts module because layouts are not native to ejs.  This being said, a layouts ejs file allows you to build boiler plates for static html markup that will be used in all of your pages.  Use cases for your layouts file would be similar to that of partials, being your head, header, footer and nav.  The layouts file allows you to render all of the boilerplate layout on all pages but does not render the body each individual page.  The bodies are defined and templated in their respected ejs files; index, about, etc.

Now, since layouts are not native to ejs, there are partials that I mentioned above which are native to ejs.  These work very similarly to layouts in that their use cases are to render the partial html that is static and reusable, like navs, heads, headers, and footers.  Once you have built out your partial file, you can then include that partial file in, say your index.ejs, by using <%- include"partial-file-path"%>.  This is just an introduction to what you can do with ejs, but we will talk more in the future about how this templating markup actually works and what everything is doing.

It is also important to note that when writing your ejs files you can write javascipt into your templating for sakes of looping through an array of information that you will be rendering, or using if\else statements to render certain content based on your conditions.  In order to do this you will wrap your whole function in ejs markup and then each opening and closing bracket for the function also get their own ejs markup.  It is difficult to understand without showing you, but there is a great video series on youtube that walks you through basic setup and use of ejs that you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7sCSgsRZ-slYARh3YJIqPGZqtGVqZRGt)
