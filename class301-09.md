## Refactoring

It is important to write understandable code, but it is more important to write functional *and* readable code.  In order to do this, you first need to understand how the code is working, but then you need to implement a way to write that code efficiently.  Often times you will have imutable data, where the value of an object doesn't change.  An example would be an object with a set structure of key\value pairs, but then we want to take that information and return different data.  The long hand method here would be to take that data and return a different set of data according to our parameters, but then, the idea here is to use callback functions in order to return the desired output without changing the initial data that we took in.  Using a for loop we can iterate over a set of data and push out a different set of data...or we can write a couple of simple functions that get used inside of that initial function to still return that expected output.  On another note, it is very effective to simply chain methods on one set of data so that all of those methods happen asynchronously.

This whole concecpt is called higher-order functions, where we pass a function into another function as an argument.  By defining the expected operations in one place, and then using them to create our new data, we can refactor our code to only have ten lines instead of 50 \(insert arbitrary number here\).  Basically, instead of using a function to cycle through all of these different expected or unexpected outputs, we can define those expressions in one line, assign them to a variable \(a variable whose value is a function\) and then pass that one line into another function to mutate data accordingly.

At the end of the day, refactoring code is not a highly employable skill, which is why you would want to be able to just write simpler code in the first place, but in order to define what you are actually attempting to accomplish it is much more useful to write the long hand version of the code, get it to work, and then refactor it to be more efficient while still maintaining that legibility.  I personally prefer to write the long hand because then I can see exactly what each step is accomplishing line by line, but I also have it in the back of my head that I can make that code just as useful with much less effort.  You can stil maintain readability in your code, but also make it work better because more often than not, you don't know what data you are working with.  To this end, you then need to be able to write code that is able to work with undefined parameters, and this is where you add console logs on every other line, throw errors at every turning point as a catch all, and overall, break it down into your long hand code so that you can define how to turn it into short hand.
