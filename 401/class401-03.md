## System I/O

System Input\Output is the idea of being able to create, write to, read from, and update data to be stored and used later.  It is a stream that has different classes which allow you to access the data that has been stored in them across many different paths.  You can link multiple projects, repositories, and file systems using streams, as well as, more intricate, network streams.  They even allow you to create and store isolated data, such as files the user doesn't have access to.

The different classes that come along with the System.IO within .NET come with a large assortment of built in methods that allow you to create and access data as metioned above.  They allow you to create compressed data stored as binary and offer methods for reading these data types as our desired output.  They even allow you to use your system file readers asynchronously so your app can keep running in the foreground while data is being processed in the directed manner.

It is also worth mentioning that exception handling is vital to running System.IO programs and classes, which is where TDD will really lend a hand in writing clean and efficient code for handling such a vast amount of control with data.  Even so proper, thorough exception handling is your security for guarding against corrupt data...we've all experienced that one in some way, shape, or form.
