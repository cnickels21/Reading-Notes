## HTML Links

The use of links is a key aspect in web development and usability as it allows us to travel vast distances with a simple click of a button. They allow you to travel from one web page to another, between different pages of one web site, or even between different parts of a single web page. In order to accomplish this you use the anchor tag < a > that has an href attribute. This href attribute is where you place the URL, or uniform resource locator, that you want your link to travel to. You would use an abslute URL to link to other web sites simply by putting that sites URL into the href attribute, but linking within your own web page is a little different. Your entire project will be made up of a root directory, or folder, and subsequent children files and folders. You will most likely have a different html file for each page of your web site. This allows you to call the relative URL simply by stating the directory path within your href attribute. For example, on this page the README markdown file is the home page with a table of contents. It links to this page by calling this particular file name in the link. If this file were in a separate folder I would have to state that folder name followed by a forward slash and then state the file name. Beyond that, you an also create links that will travel within the same single page you are browsing. You accomplish this by using id's within your HTML elements and then creating a link that will travel to that particular id. Finally, you are also able to link an email address that will effectively open the users email program by typing 'mailto:' before the intended email address.

## CSS Layout

There are many different ways to customize the visual layout of your web page. When using only HTML each new element, or block, is displayed on a new line. This default layout is called normal flow. There are many different ways to use CSS to change how these blocks appear next to or around each other. A few of these methods include relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floats. Using relative positioning you change where an item is compared to where it would be normally. Absolute positioning allows you to set an elements position in relation to its containing element (any surrounding elements ignore this box entirely). You can also fix an elements position in relation to the browser window so that when the user scrolls that element will stay where it is. The float property is a tricky one, as it allows you to push a box to one side of the window and allow the surrounding elements to wrap around it. It takes time to learn how to position elements using this feature but can be very effective when designing the layout of your site. There are many kinks and frustrations you will run into when designing the layout of your web page, but by working with these properties more you will become more confident with how they work and respond to each other.

## JavaScript Functions

A function is a series of statements written into one code block that allows you to perform a task. They are very useful in reducing redundancies when you are writing your script because with them you are able to call the same set of instructions multiple times throughout your page without rewriting the same code. First you declare your function with the key word 'function', and then you give the function a name. This name will be used later to call the function whenever and however many times you need. After this you write the statements you want your function to perform inside a set of curly braces. Remember, each statement needs to end with a semicolon.

Functions can be used in many different ways. You can set a function to require parameters in order to return an output. It would then have to receive arguements from a subsequent code block in order to run, or you can have a function return multiple values using an array. There are also anonymous functions and immediately invoked function expressions, or an iffy for short. To create an anonymous function you would set a variable equal to a function that would in turn run a function expression. This output would not be returned until you set a new variable that calles the intial variable that will subsequently run that function. Adversely, iffys are essentially self calling functions that run as soon as the server reaches that line of code. These types of functions are used when multiple code statements only need to run once within the script. They are also useful when two scripts might use the same variable name for different features.
