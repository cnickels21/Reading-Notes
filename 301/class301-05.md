## Heroku Deployment

Heroku is a cloud based application that allows you to deploy a live server.  Combined with nodemon, you can build out your web app and deploy it quickly and efficiently, as well as easily keep it up to date.  Nodemon is software tool that automatically updates your node.js based apps when the source code is changed.  This is excessively useful for web development as you can see the changes you are making to your app in real time.  That is the entire point of nodemon; it allows you to view the changes in your code without using a browser.  Node.js, itself, is a compilation of open source libraries, giving you access to more resources than you would know what to do with.  However, back to the point of heroku, it is much more efficient to use than github as it allows you to build your server from the ground up instead of relying on internet infrastructure to build out your https requests and so on.

Getting heroku setup is a bit tedious, as you need to make sure that you have everything that you need, and then to actually utilize it is a different story, but it gives you access to more information than you might know what to do with.  You can run logs on the behind the scenes processes, monitor the status of your app, and maintain the functionality of it.  It is the simplest way to take your ideas and push them out into the market.  This till combined with your developer skills will give you a huge head start when getting into the industry.  Heroku does a lot of the behind the scenes work for you, maintaining servers and hardware and so on, allowing you as a developer to focus on your product.
