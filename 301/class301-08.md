## SQL

SQL is a structured query language that allows you to build out a database of information in the form of tables.  This database is what you would use to build out an API, for example.  When you create a new table, firstly you give that table a name using the syntax "CREATE TABLE table_name_here".  You then specify the columns that your table will have.  These columns define the type of data that you are going to store in your table, and then each row is a subset of relatable data. An example of this would be a table named Dogs with columns for breed, color, weight, and so on.  Each row would then consist of that specific data for each dog that you add to the table.

There are many variants on how you would make a query request to access specific information from the table.  Take for example a table full of employees and each row has an id column that automatically increments as new rows are added to the table.  You can then make a SELECT query FROM table_name_here, and by setting conditions on what information to retrieve you would use the WHERE command to specify id = 1 for the first row in your table.  There are many options for how to use this WHERE conditional, for example, using the LIKE condition you can find strings in the table where part of that string matches your WHERE condtitional.  An example of this would be using SELECT * FROM table_name_here WHERE breed LIKE "shep" would return all of the german *shep*herds and australian *shep*herds from your table.  The asterisk in this line is used to refer to "all", but you can specify a certain column, or columns, in place of the asterisk to only return the breed of your conditional return.

SQL also allows for you to add or remove tables from your database, modify your tables \(ie. add or delete new columns or rows or even change the data of a specific row\), and, as stated above, request and return specific information from your table.  Also, when defining your columns for your table, you can also set requirements on those columns for what type of data must be stored in that column; integers, strings, and so on.  When setting these requirements you can also set a default value to the automatically filled in if no data is specified, as well as even linking tables together by key; like in our employee table from above where each employee has a specific id.  We can set a FOREIGN KEY property on this and the all of those employees would have the same id number on a payroll table.  When using SQL it is very important to read the docs for the specific SQL library that you are using as they all work slightly differently.  These docs hold all of the answers as for how to use the library that you are using in your project.
