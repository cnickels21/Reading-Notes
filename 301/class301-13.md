It's one thing to validate form data on the user side, but that doesn't guarantee that what is getting sent through to the server is clean data, so to say.  There are still many fail safes that need to get put into place on the server side to ensure the user isn't sending malicious data, specifically through hard coding SQL or JS into a form submission field.  Actual security protocol for ensuring this is a bit beyond this lab or our current level in DeltaV, but a few simple steps to take include escaping potentially dangerous characters that could look like hard code, limit the amount of data coming in, and sandboxing uploaded files on a different server and only accessing them through a sub domain.  But, besides all that, let's talk about the form itself.

As we know, forms are just HTML markup that allow us to take in user input and...do something with it.  We can store it into our database, send a request to an API with it, and even just generate a new landing page on form submission.  In order to do this, there are a couple of specific attributes tied to the form.  Firstly, the action attribute specifies what http request will get executed on form submission.  Basically just telling the server what page to load on form submission.  You can set this attribute value toa specific url, a path that is within your server, but default is to just reload the same page.  For example, a login page that will render that user's profile page when the click the sign in button.

Next is the method attribute, which allows you to specify how the request from the form submission will be handled.  The two most common methods are GET and POST.  GET is what you use to ask your server for a specific resource, or page to be rendered.  Either through EJS, or some other templating markup, your GET method will access the HTML page and render that accordingly.  Now, for API requests and other similar data processing events, this GET method places the query string into the URL.  This is not secure at all; take our login page from above for example.  You don't want a users password to be displayed in the URL, so we would use the POST method, which allows us to take the data from the form, run it through our server\database\API requests\etc and then spit out the desired output to the user, all the while maintaining an encrypted and secure level for the data we are processing.
