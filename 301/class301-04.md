## Responsive Web Design

CSS grid is very similar to flexbox, in the sense that it allows you significantly more control over the layout of the DOM.  The key difference is that flexbox is useful on a one dimensional scale and gridbox allows you access to two dimensional layout.  The idea is, by placing "display: grid" on the container you are essentially working with a table layout in which you can define where columns and rows start and end, how many rows and columns you are working with, and how much space they take up within the container.  One clever thing they implemented with grid layout is the "fr" unit which allows you to have a row or column take up a fractional part of the space they are given.  So with two columns where one is set to "fr1" and the other is set to "fr3", the first would take up 1/4th of the total space, and the second would fill the remaining 3/4ths.  It also comes with it's own set of properties that allow you to define how the items within your grid fill space according to what they have available and how much white space you might have.  Like flexbox, you can define how a block is displayed within a grid, and how all of the items are displayed in relation to each other.  The power that CSS grid gives you is like building a table on steroids.  It is the same concept as a table, but your ability to customize each item in your grid is boundless.  It doesn't replace the need for floats or flexbox, as a matter of face, grid and flex together is exponentially more powerful than either on their own.  However, in grid, your ability to handle media queries becomes simple because you can reorder the items in a grid easily.

## Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions, or rejex, is a widely supported syntaxical sequence of characters that allows you to search for your desired content within a string.  I say widely supported because many to most programming languages can use rejex syntax to, for example, veryify an email address in one line of code, as opposed to the cumbersome process of setting html attributes and writing an entire JavaScript function just to verify that the email address format is correct.  Another example that comes to mind is a search engine that searches web sites for keywords based on your input into the search bar.  Using rejex within the code that runs that search, you can then easily sift through a web site and search for those exact words, or even phrases.   A very simple use of rejex would be "gr\[ae\]y" would return either spelling of the word grey. Learning the syntax seems very daunting, but once you learn how it works and how to use it, it opens up a huge avenue of efficiency when writing code.
