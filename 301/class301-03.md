## Flexbox

Flexbox, to me, is a much easier way to use CSS in order to accomplish what you otherwise would with floats.  Where with floats you have to find a way for the desired content to live exactly where you want it on the page, you also have to use clear fixes on surrounding content for that surrounding content to still rest where you want it to on the page.  Flexbox is a set of CSS properties that applies to all of the children elements of a parent node.  So, by using {display: flex;} on your desired parent node, you can then define the layout of all children elements within that parent.  Imagine being able to modify the positioning of all of the list items within an unordered list.  The different property\value pairs allow you to choose whether those items align vertically or horizontally, whether they position left, right, or in the middle of the page, and even how much space is in between each item.  You can even change the order of the list \(or children elements if you will\) by applying the *order* property to that individual item.  In order to do so, you need to know that the order value is 0 by default, and by setting a specific element's order value to -1, you would then bring that item to the beginning of the order.  Adversely, by setting an item's order value to 1 would place it at the end.  Flexbox is very useful when you have multiple html elements that you need to display within a block, and do it tastefully.

## Templating

On a different note, templating, with JavaScript, is a quick and efficient way to take data and return the output to the user.  This data is accessed through JSON where you are pulling that data from a library and using that data to render the client side output.  It is very effective in cleaning up your code and allowing you to keep the actual JavaScript logic separate from the data rendering.  This means no pesky ifs and else ifs or for loops \(at least not in reference to templating\).  To understand this, you have to consider what a template is; the basic layout of what you want something to look like so that you can duplicate that product, but with different information each time.  And so, with JavaScript templating you have tags, placed in the file that you wish to render your data to, that will get filled when your template script runs, only based on the specific data you want it to render.  So then, at the end of the day, you take your data and your template, pass them both through a template engine, and the engine combines the two into your customizable output.
