## SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

As technology grows and expands, the developer world  must change with it.  Creating web pages that can be viewed across many different devices and device sizes has become a constant uphill battle as developers strive to keep up with it all.  There are a few methods for creating responsive, or adaptive, applications.  The most inefficient method for accomplishing this would be to create an entire separate site strictly designed for mobile devices, but this presents its own list of dilemmas for the developer and the user.  Making this accessible and reasonable usually adds more work than you need.  Responsive and adaptive are very closely related and, in essence, equate to the same thing.  Stated simply, responsive is to react to a change in layout where adaptive is to be modified according to a new purpose or situation.  All in all, the goal is simple, to create a web app that responds to the user's or browser's viewport.  We accomplish this through flexible layouts and a flexible grid system.

There are a few methods that can be utilized here, all of which have their precedence depending on the situation.  Media queries are what we will use to find the size of the screen we are working with and then adjust the content to fit accordingly.  For example, you can use a min-width property within a media query to change the desired styles when a screen size falls below that specified minimum width.  Different methods of implementing media queries include a variety of media features including, but not limited to; orientation, aspect ratio, and resolution.  Another clever way to create a responsive design is through the mobile first method.  In this case you would design your page first to fit on a mobile device and then expand the styles to adjust as the viewport becomes bigger.  There is a time and a place for all of these different methods, and it will be up to you to decide which will be most effective in accomplishing your goal.

SMACCS, or scaleable and modular architecture for CSS, is not a library or designated framework for your stylesheet.  Instead it is a way to conceptually lay out your stylesheet in an effective and efficient manner so that as it cascades all of your different styles are processed or ignored according to what viewport you need your page to render in.  It is a guideline for keeping your code maintainable and flexible while still being adaptive as your project expands.  It is important to have this conceptual understanding before writing your code as this allows you to build out your code from the ground up.  By building out the foundation of your stylesheet you can then expand it to respond to every aspect of responsive design that you need to consider.  As with all processes that a computer runs through, you must lay this out step by step so that there are no details that get overlooked and your application will be usable for everyone.
