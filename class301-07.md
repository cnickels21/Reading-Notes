## API's Continued

As we've discussed, API's are application programming interfaces.  There are thousands, probably even millions of existing API's out there that you have access to.  But first, you need to have a live server in order to access those API's.  The idea is, once you have a live server, and a front end web page for data to render to, you pull in the information from an API in order to render that particular data accordingly.  Up to this point we have used pre built libraries of JSON data to access that information.  Accessing the information from an API is very similar to gathering and rendering the data from a JSON file.  The key difference is, take the weather for example, data that is always changing can't be hard coded into a library for you to access.  And so, with your live server, when the user makes an HTTPS request, your server uses an API request to go out to someone else's sever, pull their data into your application and then return that data to the user accordingly.  So, in short, an API is how computers speak to each other in order to pass information back and forth for a multitude of purposes.

This process can be so simple as, "Hey, computer, go get me this information."  The idea is, in code, we are working with a bunch of nouns, objects if you will, but the API processes the verb attached to this object \(ie. GET, PUT, POST, etc.\).  When our server receives an incoming request from the client side of the application, it has to run through many processes before returning the requested information; the response.  The API is how we process and define that response.  Computers passing information back and forth is all the internet really is.

That is what HTTP stands for, hypertext transfer protocol, and then the 's' in HTTPS stands for secure because we don't need anyone hacking in and stealing that information that is being passed through the internet.  The reason it is called *hypertext* transfer protocol is because the response is an HTML page that renders when the browser receives that given request.  Then there are all of the requests and responses for your CSS and JS files, as well as your images and any other files that are linked into your page in one way or another.  The entire process boils down to, "Ask and you shall receive," and if the response can't process, for a plethora of reasons, your server is set up to throw an error, for example, "404 resource cannot be found."
