## Images in the Web

Images are a key feature to any web page. They capture the users' attention, give information about the web site on first impression, and help with the overall presentation of your site. They are added in your HTML using the self-closing img tag that requires a couple of attributes. First you need the src attribute which grabs the image from its respected folder (typically in an images folder within the project you're working on) using a relative URL. Then you need an alt attribute that describes the image. This is very useful for screenreaders that can describe an image to a blind user. When selecting your images it is best to resize them before you use them; matching their dimensions to the space you want them to take up on your page. This allows only the best quality images to be displayed on your page. On that note, it is also important to specify the type of image files you are using. The file type you want for pictures is .jpeg as it formats to the many different shades of colors in a picture; where .png and .gif are used for images with flat colors in them such as logos. There are many different ways to customize how images are displayed in your page and how the surrounding elements act according to image placement but most of this is accomplished using CSS.

## CSS Color and Text

It is also very important to have a web site that is both catchy and easy on the users eyes. Contrast is key with your color scheme. It allows the user to be able to easily read and ingest your content without being overwhelming visually or too difficult to actually see. There are online applications that can help you choose an effective color scheme, or you can mess around with your own and find one that works! But, parallel to your color scheme, there is also the physical customization of your text itself. This includes font-type, font-style, line spacing, word spacing, letter spacing, response abilities for link text, and much more. The aforementioned response abilities include hover, active, and focus, which are referred to as pseudo-classes as they are applied to a specific element through a class element. You should remember that not all users will have certain font types on their device and that some font types are copyrighted. To this end it is important to declare several font types in order to have a default for all versions of browsers and what the user has available themselves. Usually you accomplish this using a list of three font types where serif is the default font type at the end of the list that your page will revert to in order to support all of your users. These concepts are something you should consider in all aspects of your web page when you are designing it as you want to be able to cater to as many users as possible!
