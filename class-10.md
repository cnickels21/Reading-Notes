## JS Debugging

When you are writing JavaScript you are going to make mistakes and it is important to know the best ways to go about finding and fixing the mistakes. Most of the time the mistake is a silly syntax error somewhere; you forgot a semi colon, or there was a type when a function name gets called. The issue is, when you are looking at hundreds or thousands of lines of code, it can be very difficult to pin point where the mistake might be. There are tools and methods to help developers find and remedy any errors they are receiving from their script. The console that comes in any web browser will be your best friend in debugging. When there is an error in your script, the console will not only tell you what type of error you have, but also what line of code the error was rendered from. This allows you to look at the specific part of code that is breaking the script.

From here it is up to you to identify the specific missing element in your script that is causing the error in the first place. There are also steps you can take on the developing end to troubleshoot your code by using the 'console.log\(\)' method, as well as a few other methods that allow you to process different types of data in your console. This allows you to see how much of your script runs before the script is broken so that you can see which part is causing the error. Again, your browser's console will be your best friend in debugging your script, and remember to always read your error messages. Usually it is pretty easy to tell what part of your script is breaking based on how much of your script does work before the script breaks.

Beyond all of that, it is very important to understand the order of evaluations in your script. When one particular output requires many pieces of information it will first collect the data it needs to run the function, but if a secondary action is necessary to make the first action work, the first will be put on hold until the second has run. This stacking flow is a great way to look at how your script actually works. Once the second step is able to return the requested output, the script will then return to the first step in this stack flow. Understanding how this process happens step by meticulous step will play a big role in your ability to identify and remedy any errors that your script is running into.

There are also many developer forums where you can reach out to a community for assistance in troubleshooting your code as well as code validator web sites that will read and decipher your code returning a list of errors it came across. Also, having a clean and nice text editor with the proper extensions installed will make a big difference in writing easy to understand code. Having the proper tools at your disposal is necessary in any project you undertake, and the same is true with coding!
