## Assorted Topics

As we know, the internet, and the technology implemented along side the internet, is ever changing.  What we had to work with when the internet was invented compared to now has only exponentially grown.  Because of this it is important as software/web developers to cater to older versions of the technology.  This is just one more aspect to consider if you choose to get into this industry.

### Images, Audio, and Video

There are a few different ways to implement media into your web pages.  Images are a simple but effective way to add a level of presentability to your web site.  You can add them into your HTML files with the img element, or you can use them as backgrounds using CSS.  Either way it is important to think about the image you are using and how you want to use it.  There are different attributes in HTML, and properties in CSS, that allow you to customize your images; change their size, positioning, or how they stretch or repeat over the page.  It is also reasonable to use a photo editing program to customize your images before implenting them into your page.

Video and audio, however, are a bit more difficult to implement and work with as they use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \(or other scripting languages\) to create their full functionality within the web page.  HTML5 has introduced video and audio elements as well as key attributes that allow you to customize how they appear and function using your style sheet and script.  It can take a lot to do this as you need to consider the video/audio controls bar as well.  This is the user's ability to play\pause, rewind and fast forward, as well as going full screen or adjusting the volume.  There is a lot of scripting that goes into making this possible, but you also have the option to use youtube or other media related web sites to implement your media into your page.

### SEO For Your Page

Once you have your web page designed and ready to be made user accessible, you will not only need to find a web server to store and host your site, but you will also need to consider making your site more reachable.  In order to do this, you will need to consider key words and aspects of your site that will make it easier to find through SEO \(search engine optimization\).  This is the idea of increasing the liklihood of your page being at the top of the list when someone researches keywords related to the content of your site.  There are a few steps towards the goal of accomplishing this, but you also need to remember that there will be competition that you need to get past to get to the top of the list.  Brain storming your ideal key words and implementing them cleverly throughout your web pages, and using alt attributes on images as well as other behind the scenes descriptors, will help.  Beyond this, Google offers an analytics service that will tell you different aspects of how users are using your web site, how they found it, which pages they are using, and so on.  This will help you understand what changes you may need to make to optimize your web site's usability, or what aspects of your site make it useful to the users.  The possibilities here are endless and it is key for you to utilize the tools that are at your disposal.  Simple and efficient goes a long way in this industry.
