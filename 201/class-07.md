## HTML Tables

Tables are a great way to lay out structured information in grid form using the table element that has tr, th, and td elements inside of it \(representing table rows, table headers, and table data\). They are used to relay a multitude of relative information such as financial forms, tv guides, and many more. You can also create larger tables using the thead, tbody, and tfoot elements to separate the table data from key information you wish to relay at the top and bottom of your tables. You also have colspan and rowspan attributes you can work with that allow you to one data node span over multiple rows or columns in relation to its starting point. There are ways to customize the appearance of a table using attributes as well, but this method is out of date and it is best to use CSS for aesthetics.

## JS Constructor Functions

We have discussed the document object model that you can use to access and modify your HTML content using JS. However, within JS, you can create functions and objects that store key\value pairs about your object. These key\value pairs can also be expressed as methods \(the only difference between a method and a function is that a method is a function that is declared within an object\). There are a few different ways to go about creating these objects. First, you have your literal notation, which creates the object as a variable, and then declares all of your key\value pairs within curly brackets. Each property is separated by a comma and can be used later to write and return information to your page. Another way to build an object is using the constructor method. By doing this you create a function that has key value pairs that act as methods to create the data related to specific objects you will create later. This is very useful when you know you will have many objects that all store the same exact layout of information \(such as a business with a few different stores that all share the same information\). You invoke this constructor function by setting a new variable that calls the function with the arguments you need to set for that specific object. For every way to create an object there is a proper syntax and method for making it, and how to use it accordingly for accomplishing your needs. Arrays are also considered objects, as each item in an array has an index number \(the key\), starting at 0 and counting up, and the value set inside your array brackets. These are extremely useful when you need to run a set of code a certain number of times equal to the number of items in your array, and when you need to return the information that is stored in that array. It is important to remember that arrays are meant to store information in a specific order, where other objects don't have an order that the information needs to be stored in.
