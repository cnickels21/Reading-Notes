## Introductory HTML and JavaScript

In the world of coding and programming it is important to understand what exactly you are attempting to accomplish and how you expect to achieve those goals.  It is also important to understand how computers function, and how you can use computers by giving them tasks to perform in order to meet your expectations.  They do not perform tasks in a way that you or I might because once we learn something it becomes natural to perform said task without thinking about it too much.  Computers, however, need to follow specific instructions every time a task or process is performed.

This is where coding comes in.  We use HTML, or hypertext markup language to structure a web page, and then we use CSS, or cascading style sheets, to customize the presentability of our page.  However, before writing our code it is good practice to first define what you want your site to accomplish and the actual structural hierarchy.  Some very useful tools and methods to accomplish this include:

- Site maps
- Wireframes
- Flow charts
- Visual hierarchy

After having laid the ground work and deciding on how to structure and design the web page in a user friendly way, we can begin to lay out the code that will make our page.

In HTML we use elements to define each section of a page which consist of an opening and closing tag and the content itself within those tags.  These elements include your header and footer, navigation buttons, paragraphs, images, links, and many more.  HTML alone, however, will only ever appear as a text document.  This is where we use CSS to define color schemes and contrast on our page.  This will allow us to draw the users attention to key aspects and create a visually pleasing display that will keep our users intrigued.  CSS allows us to accomplish this using rules and declarations that will apply to specific parts of our page.  It is also good practice to keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files and link them into your HTML file accordingly using link and script elements respectively.

Finally, there is JavaScript, which offers you the ability to add interactivity to your web page in the way of reacting to the users actions.  It allows us to do this using objects and variables to create methods and functions, all of which can perform a very large variety of actions.  A very common example of this is; typically a computer will need information from a user in order to accomplish a task.  If the user has not entered that information into a submission field the computer will respond by asking the user for that information, such as an email or password. Remember though, computers need a very specific set of instructions to perform the tasks you tell it to.  It is much like writing a recipe for someone who has never cooked that dish before.  You need to lay out everything the computer needs in detail as well as a step by step instruction of how to use the information to create your desired output.
